# Secure Admin Access Implementation Guide

## Problem Description
Hardcoded admin keys and insufficient access controls can lead to unauthorized administrative access.

## Security Best Practices

2. Use the header `X-Envoy-Auth` to proxy the requests to the admin endpoint for additional security
3. Implement comprehensive logging
4. Add rate limiting for admin endpoints
5. Monitor admin access patterns
